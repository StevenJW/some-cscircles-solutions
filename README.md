some-cscircles-solutions
========================  
thank you cscircles for providing interesting Python problems.  
http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca  

I do wish there were solutions though, with guidance...(;__;)   
hopefully some of my solutions may help others. (^_^)  
    
feel free to make pull requests! :D    
also, apologies in advance for any weird tab/spacing issues with the code!
